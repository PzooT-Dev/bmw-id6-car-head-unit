# Project Development Guidelines

## Version Control Instructions
1. All rollbacks will be done on GitHub rather than in the Replit environment
2. No automatic rollbacks or checkpoints should be performed
3. For any significant changes, pause the operation and await explicit confirmation before proceeding

## General Development Principles
1. Follow BMW iD6 design aesthetics closely
2. Maintain modular structure for easy maintenance
3. Prioritize authentic behavior over simplified implementations
4. Simulate hardware dependencies for development but design for real hardware
